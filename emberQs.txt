what IS objectController? if I’m using builtin controller, how do I not use objectController? (no proxy controllers … use ember Controller. ArrayController will be deprecated.)

do I have to have nested route for city/market???

is there an example of db structure for geolocation?

don’t use ‘resource’ anymore, just use ‘route’

maybe take a step back to learn the core components, what they do, and how they work together?

1.13 planned deprecations NOT SUPPOSED TO USE CONTROLLERS … USE SERVICES AND COMPONENTS & use attr with components 

how would you show cities now, then later add county & state?

SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE: Controllers violate that; persistent app state & decorating data for templates

research SRP: who is using, only ember? why is it good? why do we want singletons?

NOTE: watching people speak helps with vocabulary

services: singletons that contain app state
components: decorate data/handle events & actions for templates
 and high level application actions

views: will be replaced by components in 2.0. DON’T USE.
(there will be routable components)

computed properties??? what are. 
- memoization
- reactification
- use js getters
- KVO? use case
property descripters … 

computed properties cache stuff until you need to change the cached stuff
